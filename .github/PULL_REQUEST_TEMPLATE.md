# Pull Request Check List

<!--
This is just a friendly reminder about the most common mistakes.
Please make sure that you tick all boxes.
But please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) at least once; it will save you unnecessary review cycles!

If an item doesn't apply to your pull request, **check it anyway** to make it apparent that there's nothing left to do.

  - Consider granting [push permissions to the PR branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork), so maintainers can fix minor issues themselves without pestering you.
- [ ] There's **tests** for all new and changed code.
- [ ] **New APIs** are added to our typing tests at <https://github.com/hynek/svcs/blob/main/tests/typing/>.

    - [ ] New functions/classes have to be added to `docs/core-concepts.md` or one of the integration guides by hand.
    - [ ] Changed/added classes/methods/functions have appropriate `versionadded`, `versionchanged`, or `deprecated` [directives](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/para.html#directive-versionadded).
      - The next version is the second number in the current release + 1. The first number represents the current year. So if the current version on PyPI is 26.1.0, the next version is gonna be 26.2.0. If the next version is the first in the new year, it'll be 27.1.0.

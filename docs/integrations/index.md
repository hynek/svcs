# Integrations

Framework integrations are the main way to use *svcs*.
Thanks to its flexibility, it's possible to integrate with any framework in their own most idiosyncratic way.

*svcs* currently integrates out-of-the-box with the following ones:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

aiohttp
fastapi
flask
pyramid
starlette
```

If your framework is missing, check out our [wiki page listing third-party extensions](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/wiki/Third%E2%80%90party-Extensions).
If it's missing there too, it's straight-forward to [write your own](custom.md) (and then add to the wiki!).

```{toctree}
:hidden:
custom
```

<!-- changelog follows -->


## [Unreleased](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/25.1.0...HEAD)


## [25.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/24.1.0...25.1.0) - 2025-01-25

### Added

- Python 3.13 support.

- `svcs.Registry` now implements a `__iter__` method that allows to iterate over its registered services.
  [#106](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/106)


### Removed

- Python 3.8 support.


### Changed

- The `get_pings` method on the `Container` now includes the locally registered services.
  [#81](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions/81)
- When a locally defined service created with `register_local_factory` or `register_local_value` lacks a defined ping, it will be excluded from the list returned by get_pings.
- Flask: The registry is now stored on `app.extensions`, not `app.config`.
  This is an implementation detail.
  If you are directly accessing the registry via `app.config`, this is a breaking change, though you should ideally move to `svcs.flask.registry` anyway.
  [#71](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions/71)
  [#72](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/issues/72)
  [#73](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/73)

- `Registry.register_factory()` is now more lenient regarding the arguments of the factory.
  It only looks at the first argument (if present) and ignores the rest.
  [#110](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/110)


### Fixed

- `Container.aget()` now also enters and exits synchronous context managers.
  [#93](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/93)

- `Container.aget()` now also enters and exits context managers that are returned by async factories.
  [#105](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/105)


## [24.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.21.0...24.1.0) - 2024-01-25

### Fixed

- AIOHTTP: The registry is now stored using `aiohttp.web.AppKey`s on the application.
  This is an implementation detail and shouldn't matter, but it fixes a warning on AIOHTTP 3.9 and later.


## [23.21.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.20.0...23.21.0) - 2023-11-21

### Changed

- **Backwards-Incompatible**: Since multiple people have been bit by the `enter=True` default for `Registry.register_value()`, and it's very early in *svcs* life, we're changing the default to `enter=False` for all versions of `register_value()`.

  This means that you have to explicitly opt-in to context manager behavior which makes a lot more sense for singletons like connection pools which are the most common candidates for registered values.

  (The irony of shipping a backwards-incompatible change in the release directly following the adoption of a backwards-compatibility policy not lost on me.)
  [#50](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/discussions/50)
  [#51](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/51)


### Added

- Container-local registries!
  Sometimes it's useful to bind a value or factory only to a container.
  For example, request metadata or authentication information.

  You can now achieve that with `svcs.Container.register_local_factory()` and `svcs.Container.register_local_value()`.
  Once something local is registered, a registry is transparently created and it takes precedence over the global one when a service is requested.
  The local registry is closed together with the container.
  [#56](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/56)

- Flask: `svcs.flask.registry` which is a `werkzeug.local.LocalProxy` for the currently active registry on `flask.current_app`.


### Fixed

- We've stopped rewriting the public names of our objects and `typing.get_type_hints()` now works on them as expected for Python 3.10 and later.
  [#52](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/issues/52)
  [#53](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/53)

- The detection of container arguments in `svcs.Registry()` when using string-based type annotations is more robust now.
  [#55](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/55)


## [23.20.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.19.0...23.20.0) - 2023-09-05

### Added

- [Backwards-compatibility](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md)!
  *svcs* is pronounced stable now -- no more rug-pulls planned!
  [#36](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/36)

- Flask: `svcs.flask.container` which is a `werkzeug.local.LocalProxy` (like, for example, `flask.current_app`) and is the currently active container when accessed within a request context.


## [23.19.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.18.0...23.19.0) - 2023-08-21

### Changed

- Various optimizations & cleanups.


## [23.18.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.17.0...23.18.0) - 2023-08-17

### Added

- Flask: `svcs.flask.get_registry()`.

- Starlette integration.
  [#31](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/31)


## [23.17.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.16.0...23.17.0) - 2023-08-15

### Added

- FastAPI integration.
  [#30](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/30)


## [23.16.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.15.0...23.16.0) - 2023-08-14

### Added

- *enter* keyword argument to all `register_(value|factory)()`.
  It prevents *svcs* from entering context managers if the factory returns one.
  This is useful for context managers like database transactions that you want to start manually.

- Services acquired using `aget()` now also can receive the current container if they take one argument that is named `svcs_container` or that is annotated as being `svcs.Container` and has any name.


## [23.15.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.14.0...23.15.0) - 2023-08-14

### Added

- A `ResourceWarning` is now raised when a container or a registry are garbage-collected with pending cleanups.


### Changed

- Cleanups for services are internally context managers now.
  For your convenience, if you pass an (async) generator function for a factory, the registry will automatically wrap it for you into an (async) context manager.
  [#29](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/29)

- Pyramid: `svcs.pyramid.get()` now takes a Pyramid request as the first argument.
  `svcs.pyramid.get_pings()` also doesn't look at thread locals anymore.
  If you still want to use thread locals, you can use `svcs.pyramid.from_svcs(None)` to obtain the currently active container.

- Flask: `replace_(value|factory)()` is now called `overwrite_(value|factory())` to be consistent with the docs lingo.
  They also completely reset the instantiation cache now (practically speaking: they close the container).


### Removed

- `svcs.Container.forget_about()`.
  It doesn't make any sense in a world of recursive dependencies.
  Just reset the container using `svcs.Container.(a)close()`.


## [23.14.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.13.0...23.14.0) - 2023-08-11

### Added

- AIOHTTP: missing `aget_abstract()` function.
- Pyramid: missing `get_pings()` function.


## [23.13.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.12.0...23.13.0) - 2023-08-11

### Added

- AIOHTTP integration.


## [23.12.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.11.0...23.12.0) - 2023-08-09

### Added

- *svcs* now logs registrations at debug level along with a stacktrace.
  So if you ever get confused where your factories are coming from, set the log level to debug and trace your registrations!


### Changed

- Ooof.
  It's obvious in hindsight, but accessing anything directly on a request object like in the `request.svcs.get()` examples erases type information and everything becomes a big soup of `Any`.

  Therefore, we've added a new "best practice" for integrations to have a `svcs_from()` function that extracts containers from request objects (or from thread locals in the case of Flask).


## [23.11.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.10.0...23.11.0) - 2023-08-08

### Changed

- Factory results of None are now treated like every other result and cached.
  [#22](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/22)

- Calling `Container.get()` on a service that has an async factory now raises a `TypeError`.
  [#21](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/21)


### Added

- API reference docs!

- A **huge** [glossary](https://svcs.hynek.me/en/stable/glossary.html) that should have been a book.
  [#20](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/20)


## [23.10.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.9.0...23.10.0) - 2023-08-07

### Added

- Proper documentation at <https://svcs.hynek.me/>!
  I guess it's getting serious.
  [#17](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/17)

- Pyramid integration.

  Please note that not all integrations will be shipped with *svcs* proper once it is stable.
  Some will be moved to separate packages and Pyramid is a prime contender for that.


## [23.9.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.8.0...23.9.0) - 2023-08-06

### Changed

- `Container.get()` and `Container.aget()` now have type hints that only work with concrete classes but allow for type checking without repeating yourself.
  If you want to use abstract classes like `typing.Protocol` or ABCs, you can use `Container.get_abstract()` and `Container.aget_abstract()` instead.


### Added

- `Container.get_abstract()` and `Container.aget_abstract()`.
  They behave like `Container.get()` and `Container.aget()` before.

- It is now possible to check if a service type is registered with a `Registry` by using `in`.

- It is now possible to check if a service type has a cached instance within a `Container` by using `in`.

- `Registry` and `Container` are now also an (async) context managers that call `close()` / `aclose()` on exit automatically.


## [23.8.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.7.0...23.8.0) - 2023-08-04

### Added

- It's now possible to request multiple services at once by passing multiple types to `Container.get()` and `Container.aget()`.
  [#15](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/15)


## [23.7.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.6.0...23.7.0) - 2023-08-02

### Added

- Factories now may take a parameter called `svcs_container` or that is annotated to be `svcs.Container`.
  In this case the factory will receive the current container as a first positional argument.
  This allows for recursive factories without global state.
  [#10](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/10)


## [23.6.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.5.0...23.6.0) - 2023-07-31

### Changed

- Renamed `Container.forget_service_type()` to `Container.forget_about()`.


### Fixed

- `svcs.flask.init_app()`'s type hints now take into account custom `flask.Flask` subclasses.


## [23.5.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.4.0...23.5.0) - 2023-07-26

### Added

- Registered factory/value clean up!
  It is now possible to register an `on_registry_close` hook that is called once the `Registry`'s `(a)close()` method is called.


## [23.4.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.3.0...23.4.0) - 2023-07-24

### Changed

- Renamed from *svc-reg* to *svcs*.
  Sadly the more obvious names are all taken.


## [23.3.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.2.0...23.3.0) - 2023-07-20

### Added

- Async method `Container.aget()`.
  This was necessary for generator-based cleanups.
  It works with sync factories too, so you can use it universally in async code.
- Async method `ServicePing.aping()`.
  It works with sync factories and pings too, so you can use it universally in async code.
  [#4](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/4)


### Changed

- Switched the cleanup mechanism from passing a function to allowing the factory to be a generator that yields the service and can clean up after the `yield`.
  Just like Pytest fixtures.
  [#3](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/pull/3)


## [23.2.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/compare/23.1.0...23.2.0) - 2023-07-13

### Changed

- `Container.cleanup()` and `Container.acleanup` have been renamed to `close()` and `aclose()` respectively.
- The clean up methods are now more resilient by catching and logging exceptions at `warning` level.
  That means that if the first clean up method fails, the second one will still be called.
- `svcs.flask.register_(factory|value)` now take the current Flask application as first argument.
  The old behavior moved to `svcs.flask.replace_(factory|value)`.

  The former requires no application context (and thusly be used in `init_app()`-style initializers) while the latter *does* require an application context and can be used to "monkey-patch" an existing application in tests.


## [23.1.0](https://github.com/hynek/svcs/tree/23.1.0) - 2023-07-12

- Initial release.
